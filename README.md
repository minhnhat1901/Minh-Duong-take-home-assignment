    - Run the installer and follow the instructions
- Access the repository on GitHub and click on the code button to get the URL.
- Open your terminal and run the following command: git clone `<URL>`

## Step 2: Check if you have ***Node.js*** installed
- Run this command in your terminal: `node -v` or `node --version`
    - If it shows a version number, i.e, `v18.17.1` then continue to the next step.
    - If it shows an error, you need to install Node.js. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Please choose the option based on your operating system.
